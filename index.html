            <h1>About Our Farm</h1>
            
            <p>We are family enterprise producing sheep in central Indiana. David and Brenda Day, and their three children, Nathaniel, Anna and Eric have been raising sheep since 1988. In 2012, we started our Lincoln flock with a ram from Christiane Payton purchased at the National Sale and ewes from Lori Shea, Brian Larson and Diane Klingelhofer. Today we have nearly 30 breeding ewes and are developing separate white and natural colored genetic bases. Our white genetic lines are heavily influenced by UK genetics and we are starting to integrate UK genetics in to our natural colored flock. Please see the Flock tab to see our genetic foundation.</p>

            <p>In addition to our children, we have Nathaniel's wife, Erin, and their three sons, Thomas, Noah, and Christian, as part of our sheep work. Thomas and Christian show at our local 4H fair and all three boys have shown at NAILE and the Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival. Noah also enjoys working with our fleeces and has shown at both NAILE and Maryland. Anna and her husband, Ryan Dilger, both assistant professors in animal science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, lend expertise and manual labor with their children, Allie and Josh. In 2018 Eric, his wife Amy, and 2 sons, Colby and Caleb, moved back to Indiana and lend a hand when needed.</p>

            <p>As our Lincoln flock has grown, we have stepped up our involvement in sheep shows to promote our breed and our flock. In addition to our local 4-H shows, we have shown at NAILE in 2015, 2016 and 2017 and at Maryland in 2016 and 2017. Pictures and results are available on the Show tab.</p>

            <p>We hope you enjoy your visit to our website and would be delighted if you were to visit our farm.</p>
